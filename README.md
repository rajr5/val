Life API
----

An API for running my life. Hosts the backend for a magic mirror, a chat bot,
a recipe app currently. More to come soon :)

Dev

Note: This app is a bunch of prototypes all jammed together. It makes deploying them
and doing things like users/OAuth easier across small apps. Anything I want to automate
in my life goes in this repo for now. 

    npm install -g watchify browserify
    
    npm start
